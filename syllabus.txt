Spring 2013 550.400 Mathematical Modelling and Consulting 

Instructor: Dr. Nam H. Lee
Email: nhlee@jhu.edu
OH: See the information on sections

Lecture: Shaffer 2, MW from 4.30 PM to 5.45 PM
Section: Shaffer 2, Th from 9.00 AM to 9.50 AM 

Keywords: An Introduction to R, Writing R Extensions, Mathematical Statistics
Through Applications, Using LaTeX, Quiz, Project Proposal, Final Deliverables

Textbooks: 
1) The Chicago Guide to Writing about Multivariate Analysis (Miller)
2) Stat Labs: Mathematical Statistics Through Applications (Nolan & Speed)

Grading: Final course grade will be based on
1) Quizzes on R and understanding of statistical concepts (33%)
2) Homework/small projects (33%)
3) Final project and its preparations (33%)

Quizzes will be given in class. There is no makeup quiz. The lowest two quiz
grades will be dropped.  If you miss a quiz, your grade on that will be a zero
and will constitute one of the two dropped grades.

Homework policy: Homework is due one week from day of assignment and will be
collected occasionally in class and occasionally via Blackboard.  If you are
unable to get to class when the homework is due in class, please make an
arrangement with the grader to drop your homework before the class starts.
You are encouraged to collaborate on *ideas* with your colleagues, but you
should always compose your own reports, math solutions and computer programs.

Equipment: You will need your own computer with the most recent version of R,
LaTeX, Git, Rstudio installed.  You will also need access to a computer that
can capture streaming screens with voice over. In Mac OSX, Quicktime can do
this easily.

will constitute an especially important resource for students in need of help.
When there is no particular event scheduled during a section, either Grader or
Instructor will hold an OH during the hour. 

Final Deliverables: Final Deliverables include
1) Final Report using the course LaTeX template
2) Final Video Presentation using the course LaTeX template
3) Final R package with full documentation
4) Peer evaluation summarizing contribution of team members

Grading of Final Deliverables will be based on evidence of:
1) Creativity
2) Clarity of presentation
3) Thoroughness of investigation
4) Thoughtfulness of investigation
5) Effort expended
6) Critical thinking
